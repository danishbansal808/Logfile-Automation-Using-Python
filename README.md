# Logfile-Automation-Using-Python
I have written a script is used to process log files. It counts the error which is repeating the most number of times and display them as HTML tables and also processing which user is generating how many numbers of errors and info logs.

Log file has following type of log format.
```txt
    Jan 31 03:05:35 ubuntu.local ticky: ERROR Timeout while retrieving information (ahmed.miller)
    Jan 31 01:00:50 ubuntu.local ticky: INFO Commented on ticket [#4709] (blossom)
    Jan 31 01:29:16 ubuntu.local ticky: INFO Commented on ticket [#6518] (rr.robinson)
    Jan 31 01:33:12 ubuntu.local ticky: ERROR Tried to add information to closed ticket (mcintosh)
    Jan 31 01:43:10 ubuntu.local ticky: ERROR Tried to add information to closed ticket (jackowens)
```
    
The file naming **processor.py** processes the **syslog.log** file and generate two files


    error_message.csv
        It consist the list of all erros present in log file in order of how many times each error occured.
    user_statastics.csv
        It consist of user data ordered alphabetically how many error and info logs are generated by each user.
        
Following **regular expression** is used to match the logfile pattern

```python
pattern=r'([\w: .]*)ticky: ([A-Z]*)([\w #\[\]\']*)\(([\w .]*)\)'
```
 
The file **csv_to_html.py** takes **2 system arguments** 

    First the path of csv file
    Second the path of html file to be generated or overwritten

Following command will change csv file to html
```console
py csv_to_python.py error_message.csv error_message.html
```

The HTML file produces the folowing results when opened

### error_message.html
